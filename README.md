# MiniNetflix

A project that aims to explore non-relational database structures, such as redis, cassandra, Neo4J. 


**Goal:** create a Netflix like database using non-relational database structures. 

**Main project tasks:**
*  Create main project skeleton while employing MongoDB.
*  Implementing chaching for more *expensive* operations and Redis-based locks.
*  Create audit and chat functionalities using Cassandra.

The project was developed using a virtual environment on the Windows operating system.

### Creating virtual enviroment
**Windows**:
```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\fileName.py
```
**MacOS/Linux**:
```
python3 -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

All functions are tested through Postman. Testing logic is documented after each major implementation.
